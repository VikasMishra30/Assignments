Wine Shop Chatbot

Overall Approach
The Wine Shop Chatbot is designed to assist users by answering questions related to wines using a combination of a predefined Q&A corpus and an OpenAI language model. If the question is not found in the corpus, the chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate responses. The bot also directs users to contact the business directly for unrelated inquiries.

Frameworks/Libraries/Tools Used
Flask: Used for creating the web server and handling requests.
OpenAI API: Used for generating responses when the user's query is not found in the predefined corpus.
HTML/CSS: For building and styling the web interface.
JSON: For storing the Q&A corpus.

How to Run the Code

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Flask and OpenAI libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install flask openai
API Key: Replace the openai.api_key in app.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the Flask App: Navigate to the directory containing app.py and run:
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Access the Chatbot: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the chatbot.

Corpus File: Ensure that corpus.json is in the same directory as app.py. This file should contain the Q&A pairs in JSON format.

Problems Faced and Solutions
Issue with API Key: Ensure that the OpenAI API key is valid and has the necessary permissions. Use environment variables or configuration files to manage sensitive data securely.

Performance: The chatbot might experience latency or slow responses due to network issues or high API usage. Implementing caching mechanisms or optimizing API usage can help mitigate this.

Corpus Matching: The current matching approach is basic and might not handle variations in phrasing well. Consider implementing more advanced text similarity measures or using natural language processing techniques for better matching.

Future Scope
Enhanced Matching: Improve the corpus matching algorithm using NLP techniques like word embeddings or semantic similarity.

Additional Features: Integrate additional features such as wine recommendations, order tracking, and user profiles for personalized responses.

Multi-language Support: Implement support for multiple languages to cater to a wider audience.

Analytics: Add analytics to track user interactions and improve the chatbot's responses based on user feedback and behavior.

User Authentication: Incorporate user authentication to provide a more personalized experience and access to user-specific information.
